        "Description": "This policy is attached to the Elastic Disaster Recovery Replication server's instance role. This policy allows the Elastic Disaster Recovery (DRS) Replication Servers, which are EC2 instances launched by Elastic Disaster Recovery - to communicate with the DRS service, and to create EBS snapshots in your AWS account. An IAM role with this policy is attached (as an EC2 Instance Profile) by Elastic Disaster Recovery to the DRS Replication Servers which are automatically launched and terminated by DRS, as needed. DRS Replication Servers are used to facilitate data replication from your external servers to AWS, as part of the recovery process managed by DRS. We do not recommend that you attach this policy to your IAM users or roles.",
